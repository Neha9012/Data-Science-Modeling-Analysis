NBA Performance Analysis Report
Objective
This analysis aims to evaluate the performance of NBA players using statistical features such as points scored, rebounds, assists, and other metrics. The goal is to identify the key factors influencing player performance and build models for predicting their effectiveness.

Data Summary
Key Features:
Points Per Game (PPG): Average points scored per game.
Rebounds Per Game (RPG): Average rebounds per game.
Assists Per Game (APG): Average assists per game.
Field Goal Percentage (FG%): Percentage of successful field goals.
Minutes Played Per Game (MPG): Average minutes played per game.
Target Variable:
Performance Rating (e.g., Player Efficiency Rating - PER): A composite statistic measuring player performance.
Preprocessing Steps
Handling Missing Values:
Addressed missing data using mean or median imputation where applicable.
Feature Scaling:
Normalized numerical features for consistent input into models.
Outlier Detection:
Detected and mitigated outliers using IQR or Z-score techniques.
Correlation Analysis:
Removed highly correlated or redundant features.
Models Used
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Performance Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Key Insights
Feature Importance:
Points Per Game (PPG) had the strongest correlation with player performance, followed by Minutes Played Per Game (MPG) and Rebounds Per Game (RPG).
Field Goal Percentage (FG%) also played a significant role in predicting player efficiency.
Model Performance:
Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the lowest MAE and the highest R² score, indicating it effectively captured nonlinear relationships.
Linear Regression underperformed due to the complexity of the dataset.
Conclusion
Players who score consistently and contribute across multiple facets of the game (e.g., rebounds, assists) are rated higher.
Gradient Boosting is the best model for predicting player efficiency, with an R² score of 0.87.
Next Steps
Further analyze the impact of specific game conditions (e.g., home vs. away games, playoff performance).
Include advanced statistics such as player defensive ratings and team performance metrics.
Build a dashboard for real-time player performance prediction and visualization.
